I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Cyber Security](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/), where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [ARVR Lab](https://www.jeoresearch.com/ccslab) under the supervision of [Dr. Jason Orlosky](https://www.jeoresearch.com/research) and [Dr. Jieqiong Zhao](https://jieqiongzhao.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of **computer vision**, **artificial intelligence**, and **mixed reality**, with an emphasis on **incremental learning** and **real-time 3D object understanding** for XR systems.  

Prior to joining Augusta University, I was a **Machine Learning Engineer and Technical Lead** at [AIEX](https://aiex.ca/) in Montreal, Canada (Remote), where I led the development of a **no-code computer vision platform** for dataset generation, model training, and real-time deployment on server and edge devices. I also designed and optimized visual inspection systems using **YOLO**, **Mask R-CNN**, and related deep learning models.  

Before that, I co-founded and technically led startups focused on **Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)** and **industrial automation**. My work involved the design and implementation of **vehicle detection and classification systems** using **inductive loop sensors**, **wireless magnetic technologies**, and **computer vision**. These efforts contributed to developing **smart traffic monitoring** and **automated inspection solutions** deployed in real-world road infrastructure.  

I received my **M.Sc.** and **B.Sc.** degrees in **Electrical and Control Engineering** from [Bu-Ali Sina University](https://basu.ac.ir/en) in Hamedan, Iran, where I graduated as a top student. My master’s thesis focused on **vehicle counting and speed detection using computer vision**, and my undergraduate project involved designing a **camera robot** for real-time visual tracking.  

Beyond research, I have been active in academic and leadership roles, serving as **Vice President** of the Computer & Cyber Graduate Student Organization at Augusta University, and previously leading multiple robotics and entrepreneurship initiatives at Bu-Ali Sina University.
