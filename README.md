# Alireza Taheritajar - Academic Website

I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science and Cyber Security](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/) at [Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/), where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [ARVR Lab](https://www.jeoresearch.com/ccslab) under the supervision of [Dr. Jason Orlosky](https://www.jeoresearch.com/research) and [Dr. Jieqiong Zhao](https://jieqiongzhao.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of **computer vision**, **artificial intelligence**, and **mixed reality**, with an emphasis on **incremental learning** and **real-time 3D object understanding** for XR systems.  

I received my **M.Sc.** and **B.Sc.** degrees in **Electrical and Control Engineering** from [Bu-Ali Sina University](https://basu.ac.ir/en) in Hamedan, Iran, where I graduated as a top student. My master’s thesis focused on **vehicle counting and speed detection using computer vision**, and my undergraduate project involved designing a **camera robot** for real-time visual tracking.
